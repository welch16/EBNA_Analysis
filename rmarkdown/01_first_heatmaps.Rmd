## The first heatmaps

In this script we are going to show the first heatmaps, without any
type of grouping in either rows or columns.

The rows are defined as the peaks called by mosaics. This counts as
the input and from those list only the peaks that overlapped any of
the blacklisted regions by Encode were removed.


```{r setup, include =FALSE,eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}

rm(list = ls())
graphics.off()

library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(reshape2)
library(broom)
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)

library(knitr)
opts_knit$set(root.dir=normalizePath('../'))
opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "../figures/basic_heatmaps/")

```

The peaksets considered correspond to:

- EBNA2
- EBNA3A
- EBNA3B
- EBNA3C
- RBPJ (which is defined as the union between JK92 and JK234)
