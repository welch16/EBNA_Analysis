## Association tests among peak sets


Using the annotation into those three categories, we performed
chi-square tests to compare the annotation distribution among the
different sets.

```{r assoc,include=FALSE,echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}

load("../data/RData/association_tests.RData" )

assoc[,parameter := NULL]
assoc <- assoc[ !grepl("JK",Set1) & !grepl("JK",Set2)]

```

```{r assoc2,include=TRUE,eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,results='markup'}

kable(assoc,format = 'markdown',digits = 4)

```

Here we can see that almost all pairs are strongly associated on this
partition (promoters,gene body and intergenic), except EBNA2 and
EBNA3B.


Note: This analysis doesn't consider any spatial information about the
peak sets.
